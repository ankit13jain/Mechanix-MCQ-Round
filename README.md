# Mechanix-MCQ-Round
The project is an MCQ round for a competition held in Maharashtra Institute of Technology, Pune. The Objects containing the questions and answers are stored in a serialized file. 

The final score from all nodes is sent in real time to an on-campus server set up by us using Java concepts of Multithreading and ServerSocket.

These questions are given to me by the Mechanical department organizers of the event.
